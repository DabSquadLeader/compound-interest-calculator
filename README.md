# Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview

This project is a Compound Interest Calculator web application. It allows users to input the principal amount, interest rate, number of compounding periods per year (APR), and the number of years to compute the amount earned from interest as well as the total accumulated amount. The calculator dynamically updates the results as users modify the input values.

## Features

- **Interactive Input Fields**: Users can enter values for the principal amount, interest rate, APR, and the number of years to calculate the compound interest.
- **Range Slider for Interest Rate**: Provides a slider to set the interest rate, displaying the value dynamically.
- **Real-time Calculation**: The application recalculates the results in real-time whenever the input values change.
- **Background Music Toggle**: An interactive button to play or pause background music.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout for different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
